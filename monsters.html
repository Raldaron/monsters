        <div class="content" style="display: none;">
          <p>These creatures are the remnants of a once-controlled force, left to wander aimlessly after the demise of their master. Bereft minions are unique in their tragedy and potential.</p>
          <h2>Identifying Bereft Minions:</h2>
          <p>Bereft minions are easy to spot once you know the signs. They exhibit aimless behaviors, often wandering old patrol routes or lingering near the last known location of their controller. They might react aggressively to anyone approaching, driven by a confused mix of past orders and a deep-seated rage from their abandonment.</p>
          <h2>Tactics for Handling Bereft Minions:</h2>
          <p>Observation First: Before engaging, watch their patterns. They might be lost, but they can still pack a punch if provoked. Understand their movements—they’re likely predictable and stuck on a loop.<br></br>
            Use of Emotional Triggers: Bereft minions are often still connected to their past. Using items or phrases known to have been significant to their controller can manipulate them, either calming them down or setting them off, depending on your needs.<br></br>
            Recruitment: With the right approach, these minions can be re-aligned to serve a new master. This requires patience and often a bit of psychic nudging. If you have abilities in mental manipulation or control, these can be invaluable here.<br></br>
            Mercy or Utilization: Decide if you want to put them out of their misery or harness their capabilities for your own ends. Both paths have moral and strategic implications.</p>
          <h2>Strategic Uses:</h2>
          <p>Bereft minions, once reclaimed, can be incredible assets. They’re often overlooked by other crawlers and enemies, making them perfect for ambushes or as decoys. Their knowledge of their previous controller’s strategies can also provide insights into potential traps or hidden resources in the dungeon.<br></br>
            Remember, handling bereft minions is not just about strategy; it's about understanding the deep loss they've endured. Every interaction with them is a reminder of the dungeon’s cruel nature and the thin line between controller and controlled. </p>

              <p>"Bereft minions... those sad sacks are something else. Ran into one in the dungeon's library, still organizing books. His wizard got blasted into oblivion weeks ago. I tried talking to him, see if he knew anything useful. Turns out, he kept on about his 'duties' like his master was still barking orders. If you play it right, they can spill secrets of past strategies or hidden stashes. Just show a bit of sympathy, talk about their master. They're lonely, ready to cling to anyone who remembers their old world."<br>

              <p>"Dealing with a bereft minion is like handling live explosives; thrilling but deadly. Encountered one, a former knight, wandering aimlessly where his queen fell. Thought he was easy prey until he came at me with a vengeance when I grabbed the queen's pendant from the rubble. These creatures, they're not just lost; they're bound to their last connection to purpose. They might look pitiful, but underestimate their loyalty and you're in for a brutal surprise. Use their attachment to your advantage, distract them with relics of their past, then strike."<br>

        <div class="content" style="display: none;">
          <p>We have vampires in my culture, but they are not the same as the ones here in the dungeon, though they are similar. My T’Ghee deck contains two vampiric forms. The Plague Bearer and the Blood Hunter. Both represent death. Both represent the end of days. But one is considered deliberate, thirst-based evil, and the other, the Plague Bearer, is a study on how one’s poor actions can ripple through time and become amplified and doom us all. The vampires here on this seventh floor are a combination of the two. It is strange that our traditions are so different yet the same. I have not met any fellow crawlers cursed with vampirism, but I have met my fair share of vampire mobs and NPCs. The monster ones cannot be reasoned with. They are fast. Faster than you think. They are insatiable. They are strong. Yet they are not mindless. In fact, I believe the curse of vampirism greatly increases their intelligence. They cast spells. They wish to surround themselves with protectors. Do not underestimate them. Do not rely solely on your own mythology to defeat them. My best advice is to avoid them, and if they’ve moved into an area you occupy, move away as quickly as you can.</p <strong>&lt;Crawler Allister, 13th Edition&gt;</strong>
          <h2> Assault on Marcellus the Pale:</h2>

          <p> We're advancing on Marcellus the Pale at dawn. The plan is straightforward—swift and deadly. Our preparations are as thorough as desperation allows:
            </br>
            - Enchantments of silence to veil our footsteps.</br>
            - Weapons anointed with sacred oils, their edges hungry for undead flesh.</br>
            - Potions of fortitude, to steel our nerves against the dark. </br>
            - Scrolls designed to sever the necrotic bond with his Krasue guardians.</br></br>
          </p>
          <p>.........</p></br>
          <p>.........</p></br>
          <p> Gods, the horror. We didn't understand the depths of his power. The moment we engaged, it was as if we had stepped into a slaughterhouse of our own making. He didn't just resist our tactics; he reveled in them. Marcellus tore through our ranks with a butcher's precision, his Krasue swooping down to feast on the carnage left in his wake. His magic wasn't just potent—it was personal, each spell a curse that knew your deepest fears. The field was chaos, blood turning the earth to mud beneath our feet. His laughter, a grotesque symphony accompanying the screams of my falling comrades, will echo in my nightmares. </br>

              <p>"Heirloom magic—Marcellus the Pale was but a conduit, not the origin. This type of magic, as Ive come to understand, begins with one caster and is destined to be completed by another, often generations down the line. Its a terrifying inheritance, a spell woven through time, gathering potency with each passing era until it reaches its dreadful fruition.<br><br>
                Imagine a spell cast by an ancestor, its incantations slowly fermenting through decades, or even centuries. Each practitioner adds their own essence, their own dark desires to the spell, until the final caster unleashes an arcane force so powerful, so steeped in the echoes of its creators, that it can distort reality and change the shape of magic.<br><br>
                This revelation suggests a chilling possibility: every encounter with such magic is a glimpse into a lineage of darkness, a family tree watered with the blood of countless sacrifices.<br> <br>Understanding this, one might grasp the depth of Allister's peril facing such spells—they are not mere acts of power, but legacies of ancient ambition and malice, awaiting their dreadful completion."</p>

            <p>"The strategy is brutal simplicity: hit them hard, hit them fast, and make sure they don't get back up. Edged weapons can cut deep, true, but explosives do it better—much better.

              Vampires are cunning and resilient, masters at regenerating from what should be fatal wounds. To prevent this, overwhelming force is necessary. An explosion doesn't just wound; it disorients and demolishes, tearing apart the physical cohesion they rely on to regenerate. Before engagement, rig the field if you can, set traps laden with silver shrapnel, and always keep a few holy hand grenades on your belt.

              Remember, a vampire down is not a vampire out. Continue the assault until you're certain nothing can rise. It's not just about spilling their blood; it's about ensuring every piece is scattered to the winds."<br>
